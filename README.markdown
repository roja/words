# Words - A fast, easy to use interface to WordNet® with cross ruby distribution compatability. #

## About ##

Words implements a fast interface to [Wordnet®](http://wordnet.princeton.edu) which provides both a pure ruby and an FFI powered backend over the same easy-to-use API. The FFI backend makes use of [Tokyo Cabinet](http://1978th.net/tokyocabinet/) and the FFI interface, [rufus-tokyo](http://github.com/jmettraux/rufus-tokyo), to provide cross ruby distribution compatability and blistering speed. The pure ruby interface operates on a special ruby optimised index along with the basic dictionary files provided by WordNet®. I have attempted to provide ease of use in the form of a simple yet powerful api and installation is a sintch!

* Version 0.2 Introduced Pure Ruby Backend
* Version 0.3 Introduced Evocation Support (see examples & below) as developed by the [Wordnet® Evocation Project](http://wordnet.cs.princeton.edu/downloads/evocation/release-0.4/README.TXT) 

## Pre-Installation ##

First ensure you have a copy of the wordnet data files. This is generally available from your Linux/OSX package manager:

    #Ubuntu
    sudo apt-get install wordnet-base
    
    #Fedora/RHL
    sudo yum update wordnet
    
    #MacPorts
    sudo port install wordnet
    
or you can simply download and install (Unix/OSX):

	wget http://wordnetcode.princeton.edu/3.0/WNdb-3.0.tar.gz
	sudo mkdir /usr/local/share/wordnet
	sudo tar -C /usr/local/share/wordnet/ -xzf WNdb-3.0.tar.gz
	
or (Windows)

	Download http://wordnetcode.princeton.edu/3.0/WNdb-3.0.tar.gz
	Unzip

## For Tokyo Backend Only ##

Unless you want to use the tokyo backend you are now ready to install Words && build the data, otherwise if you want to use the tokyo backend (FAST!) you will also need [Tokyo Cabinet](http://1978th.net/tokyocabinet/) installed. It should be nice and easy... something like:

    # osx users should, if ports is installed, simply do
    sudo ports install tokyocabinet

    # otherwise the best route is from source
    wget http://1978th.net/tokyocabinet/tokyocabinet-1.4.41.tar.gz
    tar -xzf tokyocabinet-1.4.41.tar.gz
    cd tokyocabinet-1.4.41/
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install
    
## GEM Installation ##

After this it should be just a gem to install. For those of you with old rubygems versions first:

    gem install gemcutter  # These two steps are only necessary if you haven't
    gem tumble             # yet installed the gemcutter tools
    
Otherwise and after it's simply:

	gem install words
	
Then your ready to rock and roll. :)

## Build Data ##

To build the wordnet dataset (or index for pure) file yourself, from the original wordnet files, you can use the bundled "build_wordnet" command

	build_wordnet -h # this will give you the usage information & additional options/features
	
	# this would attempt to build the tokyo backend data locating the original wordnet files through a search...
	sudo build_wordnet -v --build-tokyo
	
	# this would attempt to build the pure backend index locating the original wordnet files through a search...
	sudo build_wordnet -v --build-pure
	
	# this would attempt to build the tokyo backend index as above but also builds the evocations information into the dataset
	sudo build_wordnet -v --build-pure --build-evocations

## Usage ##

Heres a few little examples of using words within your programs.

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'words'
    
    data = Words::Words.new # or: data = Words::Words.new(:pure) for the pure ruby backend
    
    # locate a word
    lemma = data.find("bat")
    
    lemma.to_s # => bat, noun/verb
    lemma.available_pos.inspect # => [:noun, :verb]
    
    lemma.synsets(:noun) # => array of synsets which represent nouns of the lemma bat
    # or
    lemma.nouns # => array of synsets which represent nouns of the lemma bat
    lemma.noun_ids # => array of synsets ids which represent nouns of the lemma bat
    lemma.verbs? #=> true
    
    # specify a sense
    sense = lemma.nouns.last
    sense2 = lemma.nouns[2]
    
    sense.gloss # => a club used for hitting a ball in various games
    sense2.words # => ["cricket bat", "bat"]
    sense2.lexical_description # => a description of the lexical meaning of the synset
    sense.relations.first # => "Semantic hypernym relation between n02806379 and n03053474"

    sense.relations(:hyponym) # => Array of hyponyms associated with the sense
    # or
    sense.hyponyms # => Array of hyponyms associated with the sense
    sense.hyponyms? # => true
    
    sense.relations.first.is_semantic? # => true
    sense.relations.first.source_word # => nil
    sense.relations.first.destination # => the synset of n03053474
    
    sense.derivationally_related_forms.first.is_semantic? # => false
    sense.derivationally_related_forms.first.source_word # => "bat"
    sense.derivationally_related_forms.first.destination_word # => "bat"
    sense.derivationally_related_forms.first.destination # => the synset of v01413191
    
    data.find("broadcast").senses.first.evocations # => sense relevant evocations
    data.find("broadcast").senses.first.evocations[1] # => the evocation at index 1
    
These and more examples are available from within the examples.rb file!        

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests ##
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
